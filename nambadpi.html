  <p>Dharmapuri is a city in the north western part of Tamil Nadu, India. It serves as the administrative
     headquarters of Dharmapuri district which is the first district created in Tamil Nadu after the independence of
      India by splitting it from then Salem district on 2 October 1965. The city is located 50 km from Krishnagiri, 
      69 km from Salem, 90 km from Hosur, 117 km from Thiruvannamalai, 126 km from Bangalore and Erode, 181 km from 
      Tiruppur, 200 km from Coimbatore and Tiruchirappalli, 300 km from Madurai and the state capital Chennai. It is
       located between latitudes N 11 47’ and 12 33’ and longitudes E 77 02’ and 78 40’. It is one of the major
        leading cultivators and producers of mangoes in the state along with Krishnagiri, and is often referred as
         Mango Capital of India.

    Dharmapuri was called Thagadoor where King Adhiyamaan ruled. Adhiyaman Kottai is situated near Dharmapuri-Salem 
    highway. Many temples were built during Adhiyamaan's rule. There is a tunnel from Adhiyamaan kottai temple to 
    Dharmapuri Kottai temple.
    
    The region is believed to have been controlled by the Pallava dynasty in the 8th century. The Rashtrakutas took 
    over in the 9th century. They were defeated by the Cholas in the 11th century, and subsequently the district came
     under the Chola sphere of governance.[2]
    
    During 18th century present day Dharmapuri district was part of the Kingdom of Mysore and was called Baramahal. 
    As part of the Treaty of Seringapatam (signed on 18 March 1792) after the Third Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu Sultan
     agreed to give part of his territories including present-day Dharmapuri district to the British East India
      Company which was then merged into the Madras Presidency an administrative subdivision of British India.
    
    It was part of the salem District under British rule, until the founding of Dharmapuri district on 2 October 1965.
     The Dharmapuri district was split into Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts in 2004.[2] Many historical rock 
     sculptures are found in this district. Modhur, a village near Dharmapuri has remains that date back to the
      Neolithic age. A government museum in Dharmapuri city displays some of these significant sculptures.</p>
